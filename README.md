<p class="ui header product-top-header" title="program that will calculate the monthly payment Solution">A finance company provides loans for motorcycles at different rates depending on how much the total loan amount is and how many payments will be made on the loan. Using the information in the table below, write a program that will calculate the monthly payment based on user inputs of loan amount and number of monthly payments. The user will NOT input the percentage rate, as this will be determined by the program code based on user input of loan amount and number of payments. The output will display the loan amount, number of payments, monthly payments and the interest rate of the loan. Use a loop to allow users to enter as many sets of data as desired. At the end of each loop, ask the user if he or she would like to Exit the program (Y for Yes or N for No). If yes, clear the variables and repeat the input, processing and output loop. If no, exit the program
